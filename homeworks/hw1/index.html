    <p>
        Hi, I'm Tiffany! I'm an ISFJ, and on my free time, I like to spend time with friends and family. When I'm not with friends or family, I like to do small arts and crafts (I can't draw for the life of me :c), watch anime/read manga, listen to music (asian pop/pop in general, instrumental, lo-fi, etc.), play violin/viola, and bake. Currently, I'm trying to get into martial arts, knitting/crochetting, and learning Cantonese with the help of experienced friends, so wish me luck! Fun fact: I'm on Cal VSA's Lion Dance team, so come say hi if you see lions on campus!

        <h2>Reading Responses</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>I learned a couple of ways to analyze the design of apps, such as noticing specific wording in headings/in other applications.</li>
            <li>My favorite part of the article would be the animations because I liked seeing each individual part of a page show up one by one for me to think about its purpose.</li>
            <li>"The placeholder text in the search bar could have just said “Search here” but instead they mention a specific city. Though I have no intention of going to London, seeing the possibility of it is exciting" (Warner, 2018).</li>
            <li>8! Interesting to read about how to think like a designer.</li>
